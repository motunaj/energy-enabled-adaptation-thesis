# energy-enabled-adaptation-thesis

## Overview

This repository contains the code used for the analysis conducted in Motunrayo Ajia's Master's Dissertation titled "Energy-Enabled Climate Adaptation in Rural sub-Saharan African Communities : A Case Study of Kenya". 
The code is organized into three main files, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the research:

1. `County Action Analysis.ipynb`: This file contains the code and analysis related to county-level climate change adaptation actions. The data used is based on the Siaya-DS (Siaya County Data Set) and Kenya-DS (Kenya Data Set).

2. `Siaya DS_General Priorities.ipynb`: This file focuses on the general priorities and adaptation strategies, primarily using data from the Siaya-DS.

3. `Siaya DS_Role of Energy.ipynb`: Here, you'll find the code related to the role of energy in Siaya County's adaptation efforts, based on data from the Siaya-DS.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary dependencies and data files available. The Siaya_DS used is also included.

## Usage

To use this code for your own analysis or to reproduce the results of the dissertation, follow these general steps:
